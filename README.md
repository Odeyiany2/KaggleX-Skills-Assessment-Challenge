# Used Car Price Prediction using Traditional Machine Learning Models and Neural Networks

This project is for a KaggleX Skills Assessment Challenge. Based on certain features I will be building a model that can predict the price of a used car. 

## Detailed Description of the dataset
* Brand & Model: Identify the brand or company name along with the specific model of each vehicle.
  
* Model Year: Discover the manufacturing year of the vehicles, crucial for assessing depreciation and technology advancements.
  
* Mileage: Obtain the mileage of each vehicle, a key indicator of wear and tear and potential maintenance requirements.
  
* Fuel Type: Learn about the type of fuel the vehicles run on, whether it's gasoline, diesel, electric, or hybrid.
  
* Engine Type: Understand the engine specifications, shedding light on performance and efficiency.
  
* Transmission: Determine the transmission type, whether automatic, manual, or another variant.
  
* Exterior & Interior Colors: Explore the aesthetic aspects of the vehicles, including exterior and interior color options.
  
* Accident History: Discover whether a vehicle has a prior history of accidents or damage, crucial for informed decision-making.
  
* Clean Title: Evaluate the availability of a clean title, which can impact the vehicle's resale value and legal status.
  
* Price: Access the listed prices for each vehicle, aiding in price comparison and budgeting.
